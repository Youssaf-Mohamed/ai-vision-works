# Traffic Monitoring with YOLO

## Overview

This project implements a traffic monitoring system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to detect vehicles in a video stream. It counts the number of cars moving in a specified direction using computer vision techniques.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLO (Ultralytics)
- CVZone
- NumPy
- Supervision Library
- SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)

## Features

- **Vehicle Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for real-time vehicle detection in video streams.
- **Counting Mechanism**: Tracks vehicles moving in designated directions and counts them.
- **User Interaction**: Displays the count of vehicles on the video feed and allows mouse interaction for debugging.

## Usage Guide

### Installation

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [Python's official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Project Repository**:
